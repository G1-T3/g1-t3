## Introduction

Welcome to the G1T3 project. This application is a full-stack solution that combines a Spring Boot backend with a Next.js frontend, orchestrated using Docker for easy development and deployment.

**Brief description of what the application does, its main features, and its purpose**

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main components:

```
g1-t3/
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/             # Spring Boot application
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pom.xml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/            # Next.js application
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ database/            # Database-related files
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Technologies Used

- Backend:
    - Java 17
    - Spring Boot 3.x
    - Spring Data JPA
    - Spring Security
- Frontend:
    - Next.js 13
    - React 18
    - TypeScript
- Database:
    - TBC but probably MySQL 8.0
- DevOps:
    - Docker
    - Docker Compose

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 (for local development)
- Node.js 18 or later (for local development)
- npm or yarn (for local development)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/ceewaigithub/g1-t3.git
     cd g1-t3
     ```

2. Configure environment variables:
     - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
     - Add necessary environment variables (e.g., database credentials, API keys)

3. Build and start the Docker containers:
     ```
     docker-compose up --build
     ```

## Running the Application

After completing the setup, you can access the application at:
- Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Backend API: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

To stop the application, use `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where Docker Compose is running, or run:
```
docker-compose down
```

## Development

### Backend Development
For local backend development:
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory
2. Run `./mvnw spring-boot:run` (or `mvn spring-boot:run` if you're not using the Maven wrapper)

### Frontend Development
For local frontend development:
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory
2. Run `npm install` (or `yarn install`)
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev` (or `yarn dev`)

## Testing

### Backend Testing
To run backend tests:
```
cd backend
./mvnw test
```

### Frontend Testing
To run frontend tests:
```
cd frontend
npm run test
```

## Deployment

TBC - prob AWS
